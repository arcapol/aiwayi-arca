"Come on we are going to be late, I do not want to let go of my bath time"

This is the best day of the year. With temperatures crossing 50 degrees in the heat of Delhi, today's bath will be a relief. It has been 5 years now that Indians have started conserving water to this extent. The progress has been astonishing. Water globally has depleted to such an extent that water is now rationed based on family needs. This is the first crisis in which the world came together under the ambit of UNO to take actions to prevent further depletion. While the governments over the world are working hard to increase the supply of fresh water, it has not led to any fruitful results given the global warming and the annhilation of the Arctic by the Russians. 

I remember a time, when I was young and water was plenty. You could stand under showers for hours pondering on the problems that did not exist or thinking ideas that never came alive. For me, it was a personal karaoke session. The depletion over the years was rapid. A few of the nations lost to dehydration. Indian government took swift steps to prevent loss of life. Most of the water was and is diverted to drinking and medical needs. Each person is allotted 5L water bucket for a day to be used for daily business.

However, scientists were quick to point out the mental side effects of not taking a proper bath. Therefore, each citizen gets a day in a year to immerse themselves in a bathtub for an hour. The bath is created as per the requirements of the citizens. Strict measures are taken so that citizens do not overstay their welcome. Few people have tried to commit suicide in this bliss but none successful.

I have been more than lucky this year. Not only has my time come sooner than last year, it also falls in peak summer. This will give me the relaxation I need to continue for the whole year.
