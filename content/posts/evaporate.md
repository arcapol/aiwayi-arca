“It is over, you should move on”. The words still ring in my ears. I hear it in  the cacophony of a wedding, I hear it in the silence of night, I hear it waking up, I hear it laying down. There were a hundred lines left to say, a thousand moments to look upon and her words tore apart a movie which could have been.

“Hi, How are you?”, said an uncle. Who he is I am not sure, why is he talking to me, no idea. “Namaste, how are you?”. These days I use *Namaste* as a catchall phrase. I don’t have to know anyone and I can do that without disrespecting them. I do not remember what happened afterwards, what we spoke about, if we spoke. 

Life is simple. Broken sentences, broken life.

Today is a different day, like always it is fleeting without any purpose, it is just a different day. 

“Hey, look over there!”, someone shouted from the street. Within moments, people started running in the street, their eyes fixed upwards. This breaks the regular commotion of the street. I should go out and see this.

Sun seems angry for some reason, it is raging red, and with each passing moment it is coming closer. It is so bright now, that I cannot see anyone, even the person standing next to me. And then it happened.

My entire life flashed before my eyes. There were no memories. I had not lived. All I had were memories of future that did not exist, a future with her. Was this my life ? Was that all who I was ?  Was this a life ? 

Evaporate.

“What are you doing? Can you do anything properly?“

I looked down and saw *chai* overflowing out of the pot on the stove.

“Oh, evaporate.”
