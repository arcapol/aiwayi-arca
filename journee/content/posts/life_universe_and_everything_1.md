# Life

I will begin by formally defining what life means. The word **life** has multiple meanings. To quote from dictionary, it may mean one of the following : 

1. the condition that distinguishes animals and plants from inorganic matter, including the capacity for growth, reproduction, functional activity, and continual change preceding death
2. the period between the birth and death of a living
3. vitality, vigour, or energy

For the discussion, I will refer to definitions 2. and 3. To put it succinctly : 

> Life is the period between life and death and one must live it with vitality, vigour **and** energy. 

However, it is not possible to live life with full energy, vitality and vigour. Humans spend 1/3rd of their lives sleeping. There are days when we feel lonely, depressed, sad, frustrated, guilty. Thus, there may be no way to live the life to the fullest.

However, there is a catch here. The biological definition of life is a generic definition, but each human can choose to define what life is. I will like to put forth my thoughts about life and how I plan to live it.

- Life is not a collection of discrete moments but an experience. I do not want to run behind ephemeral moments without enjoying the movement to reach their.
- Life inherently has no purpose. I assign meaning to my life. 
- Life is a game which I did not choose to play, but wish to win.
- This game is being played by similar players like me.
- I do not control the rules, the terrains, the miracles, the battles and other players.
- Death is certain, it can come anytime and anywhere. You do not ressurect at least not into same body. 
- You only get to play once with this body in this time and space.

The above may not be the correct definition, but it is my definition; it is what I make of life **at this point, today, now**.

Just like life, winning in life can also be chosen by me. Although, there are societal definitions of win and success but they don't matter if they don't work for me. **In the game of life I choose to define my win**.

[qoute from poem]

I have some thoughts on the definition of my win : 
- Happiness 
- At the end of each day I was able to sleep like a baby.
- I lived each part of waking life consciously without letting a moment pass by. 
- Lived each day to the best of my ability.

I want to look back at my life and say : "Well that was one good life."

This is a dialogue I dream of once I am dead : 

```vim

 God - How was life ?
 Me - You are God ?
 God - Does it matter ?
 Me - Not if I am dead. 
 God - You are dead.
 Me - :( . Life was cool. Given that I was clueless about the game all my life, I set my path and my wins for the life, and to the best of my ability I tried to achieve it.
 God - ಠ_ಠ. What? Why not sit under the Bodhi tree and be done with the test ? Never mind. Here you go, one more try.
 Me - ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

```


The above dialogue is hypothetical, there may never be a God. My body might get recycled and my consciousness may get lost in space and time(if indeed consciousness exists independently of the body).

But here is the important point that I want to bring out from the dialogue. **Perhaps I have understood it all wrong**. There may be another definition of life, with a well defined win and ways to achieve it. This forms the meta layer of life and I will try to evolve this definition or overhaul it if required, from my experiences or ideas that I may come across.

How do I win at this game ? 
To understand the **How**, I will first start with the **What** of the objectives. There is no point discussing **Why** of these objectives as they are based on what I think and feel. There may not be a logical justification for selecting these or ignoring others. 

### Happiness

Happiness is one of the most misunderstood terms. Depending on the context its meaning can go from cloud nine to joy to satisfaciton to contentment. 

Main idea :
- minimise the regrets
- Live each emotion to the fullest.
